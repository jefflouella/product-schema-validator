## FAQs

**Q: Do I need to follow both guides for every project?**
A: Most projects touch both visual and verbal elements, so yes‚Äîbut some projects are purely visual (like icon design) or purely verbal (like customer support scripts).

**Q: What if I need something not covered in these guides?**
A: Use the principles as your guide. Ask: "Does this feel like Mookee?" If unsure, consult your team.

**Q: Can we add to these guides?**
A: Absolutely! These are living documents. Document new patterns as they emerge and share with the team.

**Q: What if the guides conflict with each other?**
A: They shouldn't! If you find a conflict, flag it for the brand team to resolve.

**Q: How strictly should we follow these?**
A: Core elements (colors, logo, values, positioning) are strict. Details (specific copy, design layouts) have more flexibility.
