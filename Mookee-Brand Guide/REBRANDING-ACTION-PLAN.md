## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to rebrand everything at once?**
A: No! Start with your main homepage and highest-traffic tools, then roll out progressively.

**Q: What about existing customers who know the old names?**
A: Communicate clearly, keep old URLs redirecting, and emphasize that nothing changes for them except the logo.

**Q: Should I mention the old names anywhere?**
A: For SEO and existing customers, yes‚Äîat least temporarily. "Formerly known as [X]" can help during transition.

**Q: What if I want to customize the messaging?**
A: Please do! The guides are frameworks. Adapt them to your specific features, pricing, and audience.

**Q: How do I handle negative feedback about the rebrand?**
A: Listen, acknowledge, and explain your reasoning. Most negative reactions fade quickly if the product stays good.
